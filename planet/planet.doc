The
 accompanying computer print-out is an accurate represen-
tation  of the relati
ve positions of the planets at the time
of your birth.  The information fed int
o  the  computer  in-
cluded  your  birthdate, birth time, and location (in lon
gi-
tude and latitude) on Earth.  Unless  noted  otherwise,  the
following  as
sumption  was  made -- if you were born between
October 26 and April 26,  you  
were  considered  being  born
under standard time for your birth location's tim
e zone.  If
you were born between April 27 and October 27, you were con-
sider
ed being born under daylight savings time for the zone.
If you were born before
 World War II, or around  the  change
from  standard  to  daylight time, or in 
a weird county that
doesn't observe daylight savings time, you should  find  ou
t
your correct birth time.

READING YOUR CHART

Okay, let's take it from th
e top.  The  first  line  repeats
the  data  input  to the computer -- DATE -- 
TIME -- ZONE --
LAT(itude) -- LONG(itude).  Then the  following  translation
o
f that information is given as follows:

GMT - Birth Time in Greenwich Mean Ti
me
GST - Birth Time in Greenwich Standard Time
LMT - Birth Time in Lunar Mean 
Time
LST - Birth Time in Lunar Standard Time

The Day of the Week is the day 
you were born.

JD - Birth Time in Julian Calendar

Besselian Year - The per
centage of the year  completed  when
you  were born.  For example, if you were 
born at the end of
August in 1951, you would be  born  about  65%  of  the  way

through  the  year,  and  thus  your Besselian Year would be
1951.65

GEOCE
NTRIC PLANET POSITIONS

This part of the chart shows the locations of the plan
ets in
the constellations along the ecliptic (the path that the sun
and the pl
anets follow through the Zodiac) Each position  is
given in degrees and minutes
.  There are 60 minutes in a de-
gree.  There are 30 degrees in a constellation
.   There  are
twelve constellations in the Zodiac.

The position of each pla
net is given as  follows:   location
in  degrees,  the  constellation in which 
it is located, and
then the minutes.  The following abbreviations are used  for

the zodiacal signs:

A - Aries       L - Leo         / - Sagitarius
T - Taurus      
V - Virgo       K - Capricorn
G - Gemini      = - Libra       Q - Aquarius
C -
 Cancer      S - Scorpio     P - Pisces

For example, If your sun is 2 degrees
 33 minutes  of  Virgo,
it would be shown as 2V33.

Each planet's position is
 shown in order  from  the  Sun  to
Pluto, followed by the Moon, the Moon's Nod
e, and P.F, (part
of fortune).  The motion of the planets  is  shown  directly

underneath  this  information.  RETR means the planet is re-
trograde (moving 
backward with respect  to  Earth)  and  DIR
means the planet is moving forward 
with respect to Earth.

HOUSE CUSPS

The House Cusps in this program have be
en calculated for the
various system that are presently in use.  Since each sys
tem
of interpretation uses houses of different sizes, it is  im-
portant  to m
atch the system used with that of the interpre-
tation.  For example, if you ar
e using a book for  interpre-
tation  and it uses the Campanus system, you shou
ld refer to
the Campanus values for determining where one house ends and
the n
ext begins.

There are 12 houses in  any  astrological  system,  and  the
hou
se  sizes  vary because of the different latitudes of the
observer.  (for examp
le, if you are born at a high  latitude
away from the equator (which the sun an
d the planets direct-
ly pass over) your view of the constellations near the ho
ri-
zon  appears  to  be squeezed while the ones overhead become
stretched out
.  Most American  astrologers  use  either  the
Campanus  or  the Placidus syst
ems, which are represented on
the print out in the first and third  rows  acros
s  in  this
section.   Each cusp (starting point) for each of the twelve
house
s is shown.

Directly below the positions of the house cusps, are the po-
sit
ions  of  the rising sign, the nadir, the descendant, and
the midheaven.

All
 of the positions of these points are shown in  the  same
notation as described
 above in Geocentric Planet Positions.

PLANETARY DATA

The Ruling Planet is
 the Planet ruling the Sun Sign and fig-
ures prominenently in the interpretati
on.

The Significator Planet is the planet ruling the rising sign
and also is
 of significant importance.

Rising Planets includes any planets that are rising  at  t
he
moment of birth.

DISTRIBUTION OF ELEMENTS 

The graph in this section s
hows the location of the  planets
in  their  respective zodiacal signs represen
ted by the four
elements and the three types of signs.  This can  be  expla-
i
ned  as  follows:   Out of the twelve zodiacal signs, there
are 3 fire signs, 3
 earth signs, 3 air signs,  and  3  water
signs.   Out of each group of 3, ther
e is one cardinal sign,
one fixed sign, and one mutable sign.  Therefore, each 
 con-
stellation  in  the  zodiac is either a fire, earth, air, or
water sign,
 and is either cardinal, fixed, or mutable.  This
means  that  there  is  only 
 only  one cardinal fire sign -
(Aries), one fixed fire sign - (Leo), and so  o
n.   You  can
read  about the characterisitics of fire signs, and cardinal
sig
ns, etc.  in an astrology book.  You should also be  able
to  correlate  the  c
haracteristics  of each planet with the
characteristics of the sign in which  i
t  appears,  although
some books do this automatically for you.

PLANETARY AN
GLES

This section deals with the relationship between any two po-
ints  plot
ted and shown earlier.  These points can be planet
positions, the rising point,
 the mid-heaven,  part  of  for-
tune,  the  moon's node, etc.  In most astrolo
gical systems,
the angle between any two points  takes  on  a  significance
ba
sed  on  the  type of angle it is.  There are two types of
angles:

  o  A sq
uare angle or fraction thereof is  any  angle  that
     forms  a 0, 45, 90, or
 180 degree angle between two po-
     ints.  The square angles are considered 
by most  astro-
     logers  to  be  a  sign  of an obstacle to be overcome.
 
    While this may appear to be unfavorable, it may also be
     looked  at as 
something to change which will give you a
     better life.  

  o  A trine a
ngle or fraction thereof  is  any  angle  that
     forms a 30, 60, or 120 degr
ee angle between two points.
     The trine angles are considered by most astro
logers  to
     be  a  sign  of  a favorable aspect which enhances your
     l
ife.

All angles or aspects between planets and other  points  are
printed  i
n this section.  If the angle is within 5 degrees,
it is printed, with the diff
erence shown in the  column  ti-
tled  ORB  (EXACT)  The  closer  an  angle is 
to being exact
(0.0), the larger an effect it is likely to have.  Most  as-
tr
ological  books  give  an  interpretation  of each type of
major angle -- these
 normally include the  squares  (90  de-

gree),  the  conjunctions (0 degree angles), th
e oppositions
(180 degree angles), the trines (120 angles), and  the  sex-
til
es  (60 angles).  It is more difficult to get interpreta-
tions  for  the   min
or   angles   of   semi-squares   (45),
semi-sextiles  (30),  etc.  It is also 
difficult to find in-
terpretations for aspects involving P.F.  (pars fortuna).


PARALLEL ASPECTS

I don't know much about parallel aspects

ESSENTIAL DI
GNITIES

Each planet has a sign in which it is most compatible, least
compati
ble  and a few in between.  If a planet is in its na-
tural sign (for example, 
Pluto in Leo) than it is said to be
exalted.  If a planet is in the sign that i
t is least compa-
tible to (for example Venus in Virgo) it is said to be  fal-

len.   There  are  a number of degrees of exaltation between
these two extreme
s.  They are:

EXALTED
NATURAL
HARMONIOUS
INHARMONIOUS
DETRIMENTAL 
FALLE
N

If a planet is exalted, its effect can  be  considered  pro-
nounced.   If
  a planet is fallen, it is not harmonious with
its Zodiacal constellation, and
 may also be afflicted.

DISPOSITORSHIPS

I don't understand dispositorships
 at all.

THE WHEEL

The usual natal chart that an astrologer draws up  is  
shown
in the wheel diagram at the bottom of the chart.  In it each
of the hous
es are shown with the planets (abbreviated  using
the  symbols below) in their 
respective positions.  The ris-
ing sign is always shown as the line delineatin
g the twelfth
from  the first house.  All houses are shown by Roman numer-
als
.  The zodiacal constellations are represented  by  their
single letter symbols
