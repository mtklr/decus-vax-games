Before compiling, you will have to change constants BOOTHFILE and HELPLIB
in RMS.INC to point to where the files will be kept on your system.
Once you run the program, you will need to place world RW on the .BOOTH
file, world R on the .HLB file, and world E on the .EXE, so others can
enter the game.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to send me mail.
