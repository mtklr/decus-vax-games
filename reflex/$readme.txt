REFLEX  

Single Player game for VT100 compatable terminals.

Written in VAX Pascal, under VMS A5.2.

The files included are

$README.TXT   (this one)
REFLEX.PAS   Game source
REFLEX.PIC   Introduction screen 
MISC.PAS     Usefull routines extracted from Paul Denize's INTERACT Library.
VT100_ESC_SEQS.PAS  Terminal Escape Codes used in INTERACT.

The game REFLEX will create a score file called REFLEX.ACN.

This isn't a very impressive game at all, but it was quick and easy to
write.  You may enjoy it.  It may inspire you to write your own games for
the VAX. If you do, let me know!

Many thanks to Paul Denize for providing the source to his INTERACT library.
