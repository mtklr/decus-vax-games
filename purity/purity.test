 Disclaimer of Liability
 
 The user of this test acknowledges that sex is a hazardous sport; that a person
 must copulate in control, and use good judgement at all times; that partners'
 conditions vary constantly and are greatly affected by weather changes and
 previous use; and that dirty sheets, variations in terrain and bed surfaces,
 spouses/pimps/managers, forest growth, rocks and debris, clothed obstacles, and
 many other natural and man-made obstacles and hazards, including other users
 and customers, exist throughout the bedroom area.  Personal managers
 (pimps/spouses) and sado-masochistic operations and equipment are constantly in
 use and may be hazardous to those not copulating in control.  Impotence,
 collisions, and social diseases resulting in injury can happen at any time,
 even to those copulating in control with proper sexual equipment.  Inherent
 risks are part of the sport and may exist within your partner.  As a condition
 of being permitted to use the facilities of your partner, the user of this test
 agrees to copulate in control and within the limits of his/her ability, and
 further acknowledges and accepts these hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes
 the risk of injury or loss to person or damage to property which might result
 from use of the partner's facilities.
 
 As a further condition of being permitted to use the facilities of your
 partner, the customer understands and agrees that:  (1) in the event of a
 transfer of use by another or anything else in the management's opinion is
 misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or nuisance, this service may be revoked
 without refund; (2) the partner is the property of the harem and, upon request,
 s/he must be presented to any authorized representative of the pimp/spouse; (3)
 sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times when you are in any
 bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate.  Your sexual partner is not
 transferable; see Theft of Services, V.S.A., sections 2581 and 2582.

 Purity Test Genesis/History:
 
 Version 1 (100) Created at MIT's Baker House.  Two parallel versions; one for
                 male, and one for female.  Not much is known about this
                 version.  It was ported to CMU by ps in 1982.
 Version 2 (247) Spring 1983 - CMU/jb, pd, kr, ps, ts, mt, et al.
                 Expanded to 247 questions.  This marked the beginning of
                 the unisex versions. The story goes that they intended it to be
                 250 questions, but got tired that night and said  "we'll  think
                 of three more tomorrow", and tomorrow never got there.
 Version 3.3C.1 (400) on 05-Dec-1984
                 First  formal  release  general of this test, version 3.xx. All
                 former versions were short-lived and tended to be bug-ridden.
                 Does not discriminate against gays or bi's. Good correspondence
                 of  scores (especially in the higher score ranges) between this
                 version and version 2. Added Genesis/History section.
 Version 3.4 (400) on 29-Jan-1985
                 Internal version;  never  released.  Source  code  accidentally
                 destroyed,  much  to  the  consternation of one of the authors.
                 Cleaned up many bugs. Added sections: Disclaimer of  Liability,
                 Instructions for Use, Scoring, and Warranty Information.
 Version 3.5 (400) on 10-Apr-1985
                 Rebuilt from the 3.3C.1 source and the 3.4 (only surviving
                 copy) Xerox X9700 laser printer hardcopy.  Cleaned up same bugs
                 in 3.4; wiped out a duplicate question.  Added in verbose
                 history section.
 Version 3.5A (400) on 13-Apr-1985:  CMU/da, fa, tc, no, dt, sv, rz, et al
                 Found  that  we  had  431  questions  instead  of 400.
 Version 3.5B (400) on 18-Mar-1986: Yale (Pierson College)/ as
                 Intermediate release, with footnotes integrated into main body
                 of text and some grammatical errors cleaned up.  Begun in
                 Fall, 1985; finished in April for the benefit of a friend at
                 MIT (where it all began), who hadn't seen any versions except
                 the antique Version 1.
 Version 3.5C (400) on 17-Jan-1988: Yale (Pierson College)/mmd (CLARINET@YALEVM)
                 Grammatical errors corrected.  Introduction and history
                 cleaned up.
 Version 4.0 (500) on 23-April-1988: Yale (Silliman College)/dfc, ad, dcg, mlm,
                 and Dartmouth (Alpha Theta)/alb.  Original 400-question version
                 expanded to 500 questions.
 _______________________________________________________________________________
 Instructions for Use:
 
 This is a fairly long test consisting of five hundred questions.  It starts out
 tame and gets progressively worse (or better, depending on your viewpoint).
 There are many ways of going about taking this test.  You can, of course, as
 your right, guaranteed by the Constitution, be anti-social and sequester
 yourself in your room and take this test all by yourself; however, we feel that
 the funnest way to utilize this test is to hold a Purity Test Party.  All you
 need is one copy of the test, and a bunch of friends.  (Lots of writing
 implements and paper would be useful too.)  The person with the copy of the
 test is the test administrator; s/he readsd the questions out loud and
 everybody else writes down their answers.  We have no definite rules as to
 whether the participants are required to divulge their answers; that is up to
 the group to decide.  However, each person's purity score should be made common
 knowledge.  (The person with the highest score gets to be giggled at for the
 rest of his/her life.)  This works great at parties and lets everybody know
 who's easy and who isn't, so you'll know who to go home with.  Don't leave home
 without it.
 
 Definitions
 
 All questions in this test pertain to events that have happened to you
 subsequent to your weaning and babyhood/infancy.  Anything that may have
 happened before that time is considered not standing and void.
 
 The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating you AND/OR you
 masturbating someone else, not exclusively both at the same time.
 
 We would also like to define having sex in the homosexual case; homosexual sex
 has occurred when both partners are of the same sex and one of the partners has
 an orgasm while there is some contact between the genitals of both partners.
 
 We would now like to bring to your attention that there is no passing nor
 failing score.  Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much about getting a
 high score...  even if you do get giggled at for the rest of your life.
                        --- ALL TECHNICALITIES COUNT ---

 I. Scoring
 Congratulations!  You are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper containing
 lots of itty-bitty answers to the Purity Test.  Sworn to excellence of
 workmanship, we now give you directions on how to calculate your Purity score.
 There are several methods; the calculator method works best.  Also there is the
 a la mainframe method.  (A DECsystem-2060 works great as a PC.)
 
 Scoring method:  Count "yes" answers.
                  Subtract that number from 500.
                  Divide the result by 5.
                  The result is your percentage purity.
 
 The higher the number, the more pure you are; in the same vein, the lower the
 score, the more of a sleaze-bag you are.
 
 For your reference, we include calculator directions:
      For people with real calculators (HP):
                <# of NO answers> [ENTER] 5 /
      For people with other (dinky) calculators:
                <# of NO answers> / 5 =
