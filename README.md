# Wha?

Some old games from the [DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECUS) [Library Compendium](http://www.decuslib.com) that I'm trying to get working on a modern computer (Mac OS X 10.11.6.)

I'm only dealing with the C programs at the moment, each in its own branch: aralu, chess, cribbage.

Aralu is what I'm mainly interested in. It's a roguelike by Andrew Vassallo from 1991 that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you have more info let me know.
