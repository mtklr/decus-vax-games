I have had quite a few requests for a compiled version of the three files
in this directory.  Since all waikato.ac.nz games use the compiled versions,
it made sense to offer these, since the source is available anyway.  Don't
forget to transfer them in binary mode.

This directory contains:

INTERACT.OLB
INTERACT.PEN
UTIL.OLB

If you encounter any problems, e-mail me (masmummy@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu).

Thanks,
Bill
