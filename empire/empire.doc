                        THE WARGAME OF THE CENTURY
                                Version 5.0


  EMPIRE is a simulation of a full-scale  war  between  two  emperors,  the
computer  and you.  Naturally, there is only room for one, so the object of
the game is to destroy the other.  The computer plays  by  the  same  rules
that you do.

  There are several changes from earlier versions.  A  differences  section
is  included  at  the  end  of these instructions for those who have played
before under versions 3.xx or 4.xx.

  The map is a rectangle 600*1000 miles on a side.  The resolution  is  10,
so  the  map  you  see  is  60*100.  The map consists of sea='.', land='+',
Uncontrolled cities='*', Computer-controlled cities='X', and Your dominated
cities='O'.   Each emperor gets 1 move per round (1 round=1 day), moves are
done sequentially.

  The map is displayed on the player's screen during movement.  Each  piece
is  represented  by  a unique character on the map.  With a few exceptions,
you can only have ONE piece on a given location.  On the map, you are shown
only  the  8  squares  adjacent to your units.  This information is updated
before and after every move.  The map displays the most recent  information
known.

  The game starts by assigning you one city  and  the  computer  one  city.
Cities can produce new units.  Every city that you own produces more pieces
for you according to the cost of the desired unit.  The typical play of the
game  is  to  issue  the  Automove command until you decide to do something
special.  During movement in each round, the player  is  prompted  to  move
each  piece that does not otherwise have an assigned function.  If you want
to start a new game, any earlier EMSAVE.DAT files must be deleted to  avoid
continuing  the  earlier  game.   Experienced  players will find difficulty
level 8 and 9 games the most challenging.  Difficulty level  10  games  are
not reliablably challenging.

  Map coordinates are 4-digit numbers.  the first two digits are  the  row,
the second two digits are the column.

 The pieces are as follows:
 
Piece           Yours   Enemy   Moves   Hits    Cost
 
ARMY              A     a       1       1        5(6)
FIGHTER           F     f       4       1       10(12)
DESTROYER         D     d       2       3       20(24)
SUBMARINE         S     s       2       2       25(30)
TROOP TRANSPORT   T     t       2       3       30(36)

 The second column shows the map representation for your units.
 The third shows the representations of enemy units.
 Moves is the number of squares that unit can move in a single round.
 Hits is the amount of damage a unit can take before it is destroyed.
 Cost is the number of rounds needed to produce another of the same unit.
 The number in parenthesis is the cost for a city to produce the 1st unit.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PIECES
Army:  Armies move only on land.  ONLY ARMIES  CAN  CAPTURE  CITIES.   They
          have  a  50% probability of doing so.  Attacking one's own cities
          results in the army's destruction.   Armies  can  be  carried  by
          troop  transports.   Just move the army on the transport and when
          the transport moves the army moves with it.   You  cannot  attack
          any  ships  with  armies  while on board a transport.  YOU CANNOT
          MOVE BACK INTO YOUR OWN CITIES WITH AN ARMY  unless  there  is  a
          transport in that city.

Fighter:  Fighters move over sea or land.  They move  4  times  per  round.
          They  are  refueled  at controlled cities and carriers.  They are
          shot down over uncontrolled cities.  They have a max range of  20
          spaces.

Ships, general:  All ships can move only on the sea.  They move  two  times
          per  round.   Ships  can  also dock in a controlled city.  Docked
          ships have damage repaired at rate of 1 hit per day.  If  a  ship
          is hit badly, it will slow to 1 move per round.

Destroyer:  Typical ship, quickest to produce.

Submarine:  When a submarine scores a hit, 3 hits are  exacted  instead  of
          the  usual  1  from the enemy unit.  This is the only unit having
          this property.

Troop Transport:  Troop Transports  are  the  only  units  that  can  carry
          armies.   They  can  carry  a  maximum of 2 * (the number of hits
          left) of armies.  Armies that cannot be carried will  drown  when
          the ship tries to move.

Cruisers:  Typical large ship.

Aircraft Carriers:  Carriers are the only ships that  can  carry  fighters.
          Carriers carry a maximum of the number of hits left of fighters.

Battleship:  Typical mongo ship.

  FUNCTIONS TO WHICH YOU CAN ASSIGN YOUR PIECES

  Other than just moving your pieces you  can  assign  them  the  following
automatic functions:

awake:  cancel current automatic function and return to manual moves.   You
          will be prompted for the piece movement.

sentry:  stay put, do not ask the player to move the piece, wake up  if  an
          enemy piece comes within sensor range.

direction:  move in specified direction, wake up if an enemy  piece,  enemy
          city, or unoccupied city is encountered.  Temporary wake up if an
          obstacle is in path of movement, after getting a manual move from
          you,  THE  UNIT  IS  STILL  ASSIGNED  A  DIRECTION.   A direction
          assignment is represented by the key which  sets  that  direction
          (e.g.:  D means east).

move:  move towards location assigned to the piece (in editing mode).  Wake
          up  if  enemy  piece  is  encountered.   Wake  up  temporarily if
          obstacle is in path of movement.  Represented by  the  coordinate
          the piece is moving toward.

fill:  (troop transports and aircraft carriers  only)  go  on  sentry  duty
          until full to capacity of armies or fighters.

random:  (for  armies  only)  move  at  random  subject  to  the  following
          conditions:   If an uncontrolled city is adjacent, attack it.  If
          an enemy unit is adjacent, attack it (even if it is a ship).   If
          an  unfilled  troop transport of yours is adjacent, get on it and
          wake up.  Move if possible without  attacking  any  of  your  own
          units.   It  will  not  destroy  itself  unless  it  is in a city
          surrounded by your units.

  ORDERS MODE
The top level prompt is: Your Orders?
 
This is asked between each round (if you are not in Auto move mode).
The following commands are valid at this time:

 A:  Auto move.  Begin movement, stay there until 'O' in move mode  cancels
     the auto move.

 C:  Give the computer a free move.

 G:  Toggle GIGI color graphics display mode.  Issuing this command without
     a GIGI terminal produces useless output.

 H:  Display the Help screen.  Contains a  brief  description  of  all  the
     commands.

 J:  Puts you into Editing Mode (explained later), where  you  can  examine
     and/or change the functions associated with your pieces and cities.

 M:  Move.  Cause a round to be played by you and the computer.

 N:  Give the computer the number of free moves you specify.   If  you  are
     playing  a  difficulty  8 or 9 game, you will probably not want to use
     this command.

 P:  Re-display current sector on screen.

 Q:  Quit current session.  Respond with a 'Y' if you really want to  quit.
     The  game file is saved in the file EMSAVE.DAT and can be restarted at
     a later time.

 R:  Display the round number.

 S:  Clears the screen.

 T:  Request a printout of the entire map.  You must supply a file spec for
     where you want the map put.

 V:  Toggle VT125 color/shaded graphics display mode.  Issuing this command
     without a VT125 terminal produces useless output.

  MOVEMENT MODE

To simply move a piece, type one of the following keys;

        QWE
        A D
        ZXC

These keys move in the direction of the key from S.  The characters are 
not echoed and only 1 character is accepted, so no need for a <Return>.
Hit the SPACE BAR if you want the piece to stay put.

Other commands are:

G: fill:  put the troop transport (or aircraft carrier) to sleep until it
   accumulates 6 armies (or 8 fighters), then wake it up.  If the ship is
   damaged, the ship will wake up when it has all it can take.
 
H: display Help text (hit any character to continue moving)

I: set unit to moving in a direction specified by the next character
   typed in, i.e. QWE
                  A D
                  ZXC

J: enter Editing Mode

K: wake up piece. If piece is a troop transport or carrier, all armies
   or fighters on board are also woken up.

L: set fighter path for city to be the direction following the 'L'.

O: cancel auto move. At the end of the round, Orders Mode will prompt.
   Doesn't affect current piece.

P: refresh the screen

R: if it's an army, set it to moving at random.

S: put on sentry duty.

U: set a fighter to land at the closest carier or city.  Useful to return
   fighters to bases when half the fuel is left.

?: display information about the piece or city. Shows the function, hits left,
   range and number of armies or fighters aboard.

ATTACKING something is accomplished by moving onto the square of  the  unit
you  wish  to  attack.   Hits  are  traded  off at 50% probability of a hit
landing on one or the other units until  one  unit  is  TOTALLY  destroyed.
There is only 1 possible winner.

NOTES:

  If you give a  piece  a  direction  or  move  function,  they  will  wake
TEMPORARILY  if  they run into an obstacle (or enemy).  You must explicitly
wake the piece to regain complete control or assign it a new function.

  Fighters moving under the command of a function will wake  up  when  they
have  10  rounds of fuel left.  This is to enable you to decide whether you
want to make it kamikaze or send it back to a city for refueling.

  You are "allowed" to do FATAL things like,  attack  your  own  cities  or
other   pieces.   If  you  try  to  do  fatal  move  that  involve  terrain
restrictions, like, drive armys into the sea and ships into land,  you  are
given  a  chance  to  reconsider.  Answer with an 'Y' if you want to commit
suicide.  You cannot move onto the edge of the world.

  EDITING MODE
Editing mode allows you to move around the 'world' and check on  things.
You  can  assign and deassign movements and inquire on the production of
cities.

To move the cursor around, use the standard direction keys.
 
        QWE
        A D
        ZXC
 
Other commands are:
 
H: Display Help text (hit any character to continue editing).

I: Give piece (or city) the function 'direction', enter the key
   specifying the direction following the 'I'.
 
K: Wake up piece (or cancel city fighter path).
 
M: Put piece (or city) in 'move' function. Type M over piece (or city),
   then move the cursor to where you want it to go, and type 'N'.
   You may select an end point on another portion of the map by using
   the 'P' command before typing N.
   Assigning a 'move' to a city, effects any fighters that land there.
 
N: Specify the end point of a move (see M command).

O: Exit from editing mode.
 
P: Display new sector. Each sector represents a 20*70 area of the map, 
   arranged as follows:
            0 5
            1 6
            2 7
            3 8
            4 9  
   the sectors overlap by 10 vertically, and 40 horizontally.
 
R: Put army in 'random'.
 
S: Put piece in Sentry mode.
 
Y: Change phase of city that cursor is on top of. When program asks for
   production demands, key in the letter corresponding to what you want
   produced.  You are reprompted if you enter an illegal type.
 
?: Display information about piece or city. For pieces, displays
   function, range, hits left, any pieces aboard. Cities display 
   production, fighter paths, and any pieces in the city.

EMPIRE Playing Instructions                                          Page 9


NOTES:

  You can give cities functions.  This doesn't affect the city any, but any
fighter  landing in that city will pick up the specified function.  This is
useful for setting up automatic fighter movements.

  Note that you cannot assign movement to a piece inside a  city  with  the
editor.

  After the exploration stage use of automatic  piece  movement  will  make
your  play  easier.   When  being  prompted  for piece movement the command
sequence 'JM<position cursor>NO' is very useful.


  DIFFERENCES In Version 5.00 from earlier versions.

  There is no save game command (once  'V').   This  is  now  automatically
  done.

  The  data  file  EMSAVE.DAT  is  a  different format, old games cannot be
  continued.

  There is VT125 and GIGI support for fancy map output.

  You can select the difficulty level at the start of the game.

  Armies will automatically wake up if a troop  transport  that  can  carry
  them becomes adjacent.

  Transports can load armies  within  cities  and  can  carry  armies  into
  cities.

  Map output now uses forward/reverse scrolling on appropriate terminals.

  The computer strategy is significantly improved.

  Several bugs have been fixed.
