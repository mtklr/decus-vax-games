[5;8HThe rules are simple.
[7;8HThe game is played in a board resembling a checker board but
[8;8Hstanding vertically.  The pieces are placed on the board one
[9;8Hat a time until a winner is declared or there is no more room
[10;8Hon the board and there is a draw ( should you be so lucky ).
[12;8HEach piece is either a "O" one of yours or a "X" one of the
[13;8Hcomputers.  To place a piece you simply enter the column No.
[14;8HThe piece will drop to the bottom or will be stacked up on
[15;8Hany in that column from previous moves.
[17;8HThe aim is to get 4 in a row as soon in the game as possible,
[18;8Heither vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
