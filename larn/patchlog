Patch 1
=======
Prompted by Pat Ryan, fix a bug in the dropobj() code in main.c that
allowed the player to drop a negative amount of gold.  In the process, fix
the backwards carriage return logic when printing the error response.
Document the new SIG_RETURNS_INT #define introduced by Bill Randle when the
software was posted.
Prompted by Lasse Oestergaard, guard against out-of-bound array references
in movem.c when on the Home level.  Also fixed a bug where a 'smart' monster
would fail to move towards the player when the player was on the boundary.
Prompted by Mitch Gorman, make the EXTRA #define compile and work under
MS-DOS.
