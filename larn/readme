Here is the source to Larn V12.3.  I had made a number of changes without
changing the save file format, so I decided to make another distribution
before making the big leap to V14.0.

This distribution incorporates all the changes distributed as Patches to V12.2,
a few others that were suggested but not sent out as patches, plus my own
development.  See LARN123.FIX for a partial list.

The source correctly compiles and executes under DEC Ultrix (BSD), using the cc
compiler.  The enclosed makefile.unix is for U*ix systems (rename to Makefile).
I've endevoured to make Larn buildable under SYSV, and it builds/runs correctly
with Ultrix V3.1's SYSTEM_FIVE environment, so I expect its fairly close to
being usable under SYSV as well.

The source correctly compiles and executes under VAX/VMS, using the VAX C V3.x
compiler.  The enclosed descrip.mms is a MMS file for building under VAX/VMS.
See the VMSREADME.TXT for some more VMS-related information.

The source correctly compiles and executes under MS-DOS, using Turbo C++ V1.0.
I am no longer able to verify that it compiles using Turbo C V2.0.  The
makefile.pc and tlink.rsp are for building the MS-DOS Larn.  

The source correctly compiles and executes under OS/2, using Microsoft C.
The makefile.os2, os2larn.def and os2larn.lnk are for building the OS/2 Larn.  

I am interested in receiving source changes that allow Larn to be ported or
built correctly on other architectures or operating systems.  I am also 
interested in constructive changes or additions to improve the game.  

Bug fixes, bug reports, and requests welcome.
