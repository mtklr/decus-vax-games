7    Welcome to the game of Larn.  At this moment, you face a great problem.
Your daughter has contracted a strange disease, and none of your home remedies
seem to have any effect.  You sense that she is in mortal danger, and you must
try to save her.  Time ago you heard of a land of great danger and opportunity.
Perhaps here is the solution you need.

    It has been said that there once was a great magician who called himself
Polinneaus.  Many years ago, after having many miraculous successes, Polinneaus
retired to the caverns of Larn, where he devoted most of his time to the
creation of magic.   Rumors have it that one day Polinneaus set out to dispel
an attacking army in a forest some distance to the north.  It is believed that
here he met his demise.

    The caverns of Larn, it is thought, must be magnificent in design,
and contain much magic and treasure.  One option you have is to undertake a
journey into these caverns.


    Good Luck!  You're going to need it!

                Special Notes

When dropping gold, if you type '*' as your amount, all your gold gets dropped.
In general, typing in '*' means all of what your interested in.  This is true
when visiting the bank, or when contributing at altars.

Larn needs the ANSI.SYS (or preferably, the NANSI.SYS) device driver installed
in your CONFIG.SYS file.  The supplied "termcap" file describes the escape
sequences to change video modes (see ch 13 of the DOS 2.0 manual).  See the
"TERMCAP" section in LARN.DOC for further details.

When in the store, trading post, school, or home, an <escape> will get you out.

When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can cast, type 'I' as
the first letter of your spell.  The available list of spells will be shown,
after which you may enter the spell code.  This only works on the 1st letter
of the spell you are casting.

When an inventory list is on the screen from a drop, quaff, read, or similar
command, you can type the letter of the object that you wish to act apon,
without having to type a space to get back to the prompt.

            How to use the larn.opt option file

The file "larn.opt", if used, should be in a directory along your PATH.
A sequence of words terminated by whitespace is used to specify options.

    Word                      Meaning
    cursor: lowscan highscan  change the shape of the cursor
    DECRainbow                tell LARN you have that computer
    enable-checkpointing      turn on periodic checkpointing
    graphics: wallc floorc    select graphics maze characters
    keypad                    enable the numeric keypad for moving
    larndir:  directory       the directory to use for larn files
    monster:  "monst name"    choose a name for a monster
    name:     "your name"     choose your playing name
    no-beep                   disable beeping of the terminal
    no-introduction           do not display intro message
    savefile: save-file-name  define what the savegame filename will be
    swapfile: swap-file-name  define the name of the swapfile

Your name and monster names must be enclosed in double quotation marks and may
be up to 34 characters long.  Longer names are truncated.  Anything enclosed in
quotation marks is considered one word, and must be separated from other words
by whitespace.
           Explanation of the Larn scoreboard facility

    Larn supports TWO scoreboards, one for winners, and one for deceased
characters.  Each player (by userid or playerid, see UIDSCORE in Makefile)
is allowed one slot on each scoreboard, if the score is in the top ten for
that scoreboard.  This design helps insure that frequent players of Larn
do not hog the scoreboard, and gives more players a chance for glory.  Level
of difficulty is also noted on the scoreboards, and this takes precedence
over score for determining what entry is on the scoreboard.  For example:
if "Yar, the Bug Slayer" has a score of 128003 on the scoreboard at diff 0,
then a game at diff 1 and a score of 4112 would replace the previous
entry on the scoreboard.  Note that when a player dies, the inventory is
stored in the scoreboard so that everyone can see what items the player had
at the time of death.
