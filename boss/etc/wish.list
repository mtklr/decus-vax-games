Things we want to someday maybe add to BOSS if we ever figure out how to do
them:

  /
\/-  more skills/book.  like, lots.  use other integer fields in the
     treasure record for more flags.  what a hack.
  /
\/-  add new monster/weapon flags:  slay robot

  /
\/-  add police to the town level that appear if a 'good' person
     is attacked.
  /
\/-  add badguys to defeat at each succesive 500meter level
     Player must defeat this badguy before catching bus.

--   give creatures specific treasure types.

--   more stuff in the office building.  finish the hospital, and the newsinc.
     implement the critical hit system vs. the player, so that the hospital
     is needed.  

--   summon particular monsters (item/monster ability)

--   make the creatures talk

--   send in the clones

--   do-it-yourself  storage area - rentable apartment

--   game film's for some of the more interesting random wierdnesses in the
     game.

--   add anything else worthwhile that comes to mind.
