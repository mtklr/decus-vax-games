  While playing any game including Boss, the worst can happen:
  You can lose connection from the VAX, an unrecoverable error causes the 
  game to crash, or just in the case where someone turns your terminal off.
  
  If you saved your character at any time prior to this, then you are in 
  luck.  The save file will normally be 'corrupted' and not usable again,
  but a special function available only to your local Boss administrator
  can 'un-corrupt' it.

Here's what you need to do to restore a corrupted save file:

  1.  Send the save file to your local Boss administrator.
      Type:    SEND/FILE/VMSDUMP filename username-of-admin

  2.  The admin will restore the file and send it back to you.
      All you need to do is RECEIVE the file and go back to 
      playing Boss.


Here's what the Boss administrator needs to do:

  1.  RECEIVE the save file.
  2.  Make sure your username is in the file WIZARD.DAT
      This file should be located in the [.BOSS.DAT] directory.
  2.  While in the Boss directory type @startup to enter the game.
  3.  After all the intro stuff is skimmed through, and the town map
      appears, type control-p to turn 'wizard' mode on.
  4.  Then type control-v
  5.  Enter the name of the save file and hit return.
  6.  This should repair the save file.
      If not, possible errors include:
      a.  You misspelled the save file name.
      b.  The file was not sent with the /VMSDUMP qualifier.
      c.  Something went wrong with the fabric of the space/time continuum.
  7.  Next, type control-y to exit the game.
  8.  Then send the file back to the user.  
      Type:  SEND/FILE/VMSDUMP filename username
      (At this point I often forget who sent the file, so it's a good idea
      to rename the file to the same name as the user who sent it right 
      after you first receive it.)
  9.  Be happy!  But if you start to get too many restore save file requests
      from the same person, be suspicious of cheating.
