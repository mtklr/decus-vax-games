This file is your key to adding objects to the object list data file.
Below is the format each entry in the list should have.  Following that are
the meanings associated with all the special codes related to object
definitions.  Look at some examples from objects.dat to get the hang of it.

Note:  Much of this is a kluge.  It's not our fault, we didn't design the
system, we just played along.  The tvals and subvals are totally arbitrary.
So don't mess with them unless you *know* what they mean.  You can create a
lot of very hard to find bugs by misassigning tvals or subvals on an item.
Ammo for guns and Laser weapons is a particularly difficult subject.

                set.  Potions will generally have some food value, found
                in P1.
 
        Ray Guns and Alien Devices:
                Flags defines a function, P1 contains number of charges
