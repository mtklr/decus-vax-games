                4000    Max Hit points.  
                8000    Not used.
 
 
        Sleep (sleep)   :       A measure in turns of how fast creature
                                will notice player (on the average).
        
	Max Experience :        The experience reward given when creature
				is killed.  If creature is a 'goodie' then
				set mexp to zero.

        Area of affect (aaf) :  Max range that creature is able to "notice"
                                the player.

	Armor Class :		The natural protection of the creature.
				Values should range from 0-200.

        Speed :                 Relative speed of the creature. 
				0   Doesn't move.
				1   Normal
			        2+  Really fast.

        Reproduction:           How much this creature reproduces when
				encountered.  Reproduction is a geometric 
				sequence, so a value of more than 10 would
				probably swamp the player.  A value of zero
				means no reproduction.

        Size:			How large the creature is.  Currently only
				determines the weight of its corpse.  Value
				should range from 1-100.  Human size = 20.

        Treasure Type :         Not implemented yet.  Values are all at zero.

        Intellegence :          Relative.  Values range from 0-50.  Affects
				how well creature can dodge the player's blows.

        Speaks:                 Not implemented yet.  Will someday add 
				personalities to the creatures.

        Character Representation:   How creature looks on the screen.


        Hit Dice:               '#1d#2' where #2 is the range of each roll and
                                #1 is the number of added up rolls to make.
                                Example: a creature with 5 eight-sided hit die
                                is given '5d8'.

        Attack/Damage:          One attack per turn: '# # #d#'
				Two attacks:         '# # #d#|# # #d#'

            Example:  For a creature which bites for 1d6,then stings for
                      2d4 and loss of dex you would use:
                      '1 2 1d6|15 4 2d4'
