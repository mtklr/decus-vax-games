			    Welcome to BOSS!
			   

	  BOSS is a new offspring of the popular dungeon adventure game 
     Moria.  Where Moria involves swords, dragons, and sorcery, BOSS is
     is a semi-futuristic game with a twisted sense of humor.  While 
     playing, your character will battle evil scientists, psychotic gang
     members, hideous mutants, vicious aliens, and the Boss himself.
     The goal of defeating the Boss is obtained only after exploring the
     chaotic system of tunnels that exist below eight cities overrun
     by the Boss's minions.  
          BOSS differs from Moria (and Imoria) in many ways.  Many of 
     these differences are very obvious, but some may take awhile to be
     discovered.  Major differences include: fewer races, different
     classes, lack of "magic", multiple cities, and less overall time
     committment needed to fully explore and maybe win the game.
          The 'help' within the game is fairly extensive and can be 
     accessed by pressing shift-H.  Read especially the information
     headed under: Summary, Commands, and Banking.  New commands and 
     changes to the game can be found under the heading, NEWS and
     really important news will be displayed on the intro screen.

          Good luck playing BOSS and most importantly, have fun!
