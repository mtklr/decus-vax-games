                       Welcome to Moria!

Your first task is to generate a character. You must specify a sex,
a race and a class. Anytime before you have made these specifications,
you can interrupt with control-C. You can also specify the race as
often as you like by entering '%' to the class request. This will also
regenerate your attributes.

If this is your first time playing, you may want to read the manual first.
