NOTE: ESCAPE is defined as Control-Z in constant.h to be more like the
original VMS moria, this is not documented anyplace, so whenever the
doc/program says escape type control_Z instead.   If you don't like this,
delete the define for escape in constant.h (but you will probably have to
hit escape twice for it to work).

If you're building Moria on a VAX/VMS system, you'll need a C compiler
that understands the 'defined()' macro.

	Notes on VMS files:

	getch.c - single character terminal input and related routines.

	uexit.c	- shell for the exit() call, to prevent -NOMSG messages
		from appearing when exiting the Moria program.

	makefile. - for use if you have a Make utility.  I use Todd
		Aven's VMSMAKE (with the unix options)

	moria.opt - the options file for linking Moria.  (You do a
		'link moria/opt' command to link the program)

	descrip.mms - builds moria if you have the mms utility. (You do a
		'mms/description=descrip.mms' to build it.)

	debug.mms - builds moria to run under debug if you have the mms
		utility. (You do a 'mms/description=debug.mms' to build
		the debugger version.)

	make.com - for those without make or mms, does all the compiles
		and the final link of the program.

        scores.fdl - file intended for use with CONVERT/FDL; the score
                file needs to be created empty, then converted using
                scores.fdl.  This is because moria expects it to be
                stream/LF format.

In the config.h file, the files that moria uses are defined to be
on the logical device 'moria:'.  This will need to be defined before
you can run Moria.
