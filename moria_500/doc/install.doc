Installation Docs for Moria UB 5.00   - Written by Nick B Triantos
-----------------------------------     State University of New York at Buffalo

Note that although this version of Moria is called version 5.00, it is NOT
version 5.00 as released by the authors of the program.  This program has
been modified by William Palter and myself, Nick B Triantos, to the extent
that it can no longer be considered a 4.8x version.  There are various features
in this version that can only be found in this version.



The files you should get is a Backup Save Set containing the following:

MORIA.PAS  - The main Pascal source program to the game
*.INC      - These files are all of the include files used when compiling
             MORIA.PAS.  They have been created to ease finding certain sections
             of code.
*.MAR      - These are the MACRO source files for some subroutines which
             are needed by MORIA.PAS.
HINTS.RNH  - The Runoff source for a file which contains some simple hints
             for Moria contributed by users here at the University of Buffalo.
MORIA.EXE  - The actual executable file.  This file should only have execute
             protection set.
ATTACK.DAT - This file contains some data for the wizards which isn't actually
             used by the game, but is somewhat useful. No protection settings
             are necessary.                  
HOURS.DAT  - A file containing the valid hours for playing Moria.  Read
             protection only must be set.
MONSTERIN.DAT - This file contains the actual monster data used for Moria.
                It is much easier to add/delete/modify a monster by reading
                them all in at the beginning, so we use this.  World read
                protection is necessary.
MORIA.DAT     - This file is displayed as the opening page of Moria when
                it is executed.  Messages can be changed, but please don't
                change the credits.  World read protection is necessary.
MORIACHR.DAT  - This file contains the database of valid Moria saved
                characters.  It is an encrypted file and so editing it may
                corrupt it.  World read+write+execute are necessary on this
                file.
MORIAHLP.HLB  - The on-line help file for Moria.  World read necessary.
MORIATOP.DAT  - The high score file for Moria.  World read+write is necessary.
MORIAWIZ.DAT  - This is a datafile contianing the usernames of all valid
                wizards.  Note that in our version of Moria, there is no
                password; just a check on who is in this file.  The wizards
                should be very careful as to who's name(s) is/are put in
                this file.  The usernames should appear each on a seperate
                line, with no leading or trailing spaces, and no blank lines
                in the file.  World read is necessary.
