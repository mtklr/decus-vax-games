Shuffle:

	I wrote this as a way to learn curses.

	I have successfully compiled and run shuffle on a Sequent
	running under 4.2BSD and a HP9000 running under HP-UX

	When I first wrote this I had a little knowledge of how to
	make the code portable, so if you patch the code to run on
	another system I would REALLY appreciate your input and code.

To compile on VMS:

        CC each file independently, then
        LINK GAME,MAIN,SWITCH,VISUAL,XRAND,SYS$LIBRARY:VAXCCURSE/LIBRARY,
             SYS$LIBRARY:VAXCRTL
        RENAME GAME.EXE to SHUFFLE.EXE
