You should have:

Makefile:	this is the makefile, it needs some modification of directory
		names

shuffle.6:	this is the unix style manual page formatted in -man macros
		you can modify the filenames in it.

shuffle.h	this is the include file for the include files I use.
		Here are also some modifications necessary.


The rest of the files are the source files, this is a manifest of them:

game.c
main.c
switch.c
visual.c
xrand.c
